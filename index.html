    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I was born in Van Wert, Ohio, on February 10th of 2005. <br>
        I graduated from Paulding High School in 2023 and
        I am a second-year student at NSCC. I am going for a degree
        in <em>Cyber Security and Network Administration, 
        along with Computer Programming.</em> I did get engaged on August 3rd, 2024, 
        to my middle school sweetheart. We have been together for almost 6 years
        and we get married June 7th, 2025.
    </p>
    

    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p>
        My family is very important to me. My mom lives in Van 
        Wert. My Dad lives in Payne. <br> Including all step siblings,
       <span id="family"> I have a total of 4 brothers and 3 sisters. We did
        unfortunately lose one of my sisters back in September of
        2024. She was special needs with Rett Syndrome. My family still remains very
        close with each other which I am grateful for.</span>
